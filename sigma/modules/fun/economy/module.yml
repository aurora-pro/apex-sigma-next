  - description: Trade items with another user.
      The syntax for the command is a little specific, so read the example.
      Start the command by pinging the user you want to trade with,
      then list items you want to offer (separated by a comma) followed by the word "for",
      after which you list items you want to receive (separated by a comma).
      Currency is not tradeable. Both parties must submit at least one item.
      Trades are taxed based on the rarity of the items received.
